# Jarvis: A Social Network Analysis Tool

## Overview

Jarvis is an advanced social network analysis tool designed to uncover insights from the MovieLens dataset. The project aims to build a robust, scalable, and extensible system that combines graph-based analysis with modern backend technologies. By leveraging Neo4j for graph modeling and Python-based data processing, Jarvis delivers:

- **Personalized Movie Recommendations** using collaborative filtering and graph algorithms.
- **Targeted Advertisement Suggestions** based on user behavior and clustering techniques.
- **Interactive Dashboards** offering insights into user preferences and advanced search capabilities.

This project integrates industry-relevant tools and technologies to showcase expertise in database backends, scalable pipelines, and modern application development.

## Key Features

### 1. **Graph-Based Insights with Neo4j**
- Models relationships between users, movies, and genres as a graph.
- Efficiently processes data to provide graph-based recommendations using algorithms like similarity measures and PageRank.
- Creates indexes and constraints for performance optimization.

### 2. **Recommender System**
- Collaborative filtering implemented using TensorFlow/Scikit-learn.
- Integrates Neo4j algorithms for enhancing recommendations.
- Results cached in Redis for fast access.

### 3. **Real-Time Data Pipeline**
- Utilizes Kafka for real-time ingestion of user interactions.
- Processes streaming data to dynamically update recommendations and ads.

### 4. **Advanced Search Functionality**
- Powered by Elasticsearch for full-text search and filtering.
- Enables intuitive search by movie title, genre, and user preferences.

### 5. **Interactive Dashboard**
- Developed using FastAPI and a front-end framework (e.g., React).
- Displays personalized recommendations, user insights, and ad suggestions.

### 6. **Monitoring and Performance Optimization**
- Prometheus and Grafana provide real-time metrics and visualizations.
- Dockerized infrastructure ensures consistent deployments and scalability.

### 7. **Automation and Testing**
- GitHub Actions integrated for CI/CD pipelines.
- Comprehensive unit and integration testing framework using Pytest.
- Pre-commit hooks for code quality enforcement.
